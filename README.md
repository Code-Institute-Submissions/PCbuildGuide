## PC build guide

This project has been done in order to help user decide what kind of computer he would want to invest in without any prior knowledge.

It gives options for 3 different pricing options and a very brief explanation of what these builds contain and what they excel at.

## UX

In my Ux design process, I have tunneled on the goal of making it a relaxed, modern and no distractions environment. 

Since the website was built for people with little to no knowledge of computers, my main goal was to not overload the user on information and make it a light read informing them before presenting a link to the vendor's website.

I believe that I have done just that, by having a spaced out and easy-going experience which takes minimal time to absorb.

[a relative link](assets\documents\PC_build.pdf) here is a wireframe that I have drawn up before starting the project, however it has failed me with massively outdated layout and overbearingness of information. It had to be scrapped and re-imagined, and this current project state is where I arrived.

## Features

### Existing Features

* Feature 1 = Landing page which welcomes a user and invites to explore the content with a super relaxed and easily absorbed approach (button).
* Feature 2 = The Builds page gives user a selection of 3 computer builds that is non-intrusive and very minimal, it also allows the user to continue reading about the computer upon a click of a button.
* Feature 3 = Gives the 3 top latest news from 3 different dominant vendors in the market segment of home PCs with a timeline oh which arrived when.
* Feature 4 = Contact form, again super easy and intuitive to use and navigate as it is a simple form.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5 
* CSS
* Bootstrap 4.5.3
* Font Awesome 5.15.1
* Google Fonts
* Visual Studio Code
* Chrome developer tools
* Github and Git, both on their own and VSC extensions
* Gitpod was used before the project migrated over to VSC to develop locally.

## Testing

Most testing has been done with a local web server running and reacting to code changes in real-time.
It was all tested on a 1440p monitor and iPhone 6/7/8 chrome developer view.

## Deployment

The code has been deployed from a local Visual Studio Code workspace to github via Git. 
The deployed version and in development versions as the same.

## Credits
